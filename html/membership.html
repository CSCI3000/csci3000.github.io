        <h1>Membership</h1>
        <p>At Achasta, you can select from a range of membership options and dues that allow you to personalize the way you enjoy your new community. Membership is required for residents, and will provide a lifestyle and community that&#39;s truly focused
            on you.
        </p>
        <p>A fun-filled social and cultural program presents an ever-evolving calendar from which members can plan to attend nature hikes, fishing, concerts under the stars, xcursions, kayaking, tubing on the river, wine tasting, performances and more. Achasta
            places a premium on fun and games and a wide range of activities.</p>
        <p>We strive to create new traditions, and we enjoy a relationship with Dahlonega in hosting some of its existing festival activities on-site. Here, the software is more important than the hardware; the Activities Director takes charge of facilitating
            activities, bringing together people into groups and clubs that are inclusive and give our members the opportunity to enjoy and be a part of the Achasta lifestyle. We recognize that it is not the “bricks and sticks” that make a place meaningful,
            but the memories created and connections experienced within the community.</p>
